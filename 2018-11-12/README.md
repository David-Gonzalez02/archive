# Formal Description

You are given an array that has the price of stocks each day.

Each element is a positive integer but can include zero.

For example,
[100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]

You are only allowed to buy or sell stock each day. Find and return the maximum profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days.

Remember that you must have bought stock before you can sell it!

# Examples

## Example 1:
**Input:** [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** 
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

## Example 2:
**Input:** [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** 
In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
