## P2: Palindromic Substrings

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string. 

Remember a palindrome is defined as a character, word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

### Examples
```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
```
There are three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
```
There are six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
