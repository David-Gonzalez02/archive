## P2: Custom Collection

Design a collection that supports the following methods in constant time:

| Method                 | Description                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `insert(elm)`          | Insert an element into the collection.             |
| `find(elm) -> bool`    | Return `true` if the element is in the collection. |
| `delete(elm)`          | Remove an element from the collection.             |
| `pick_random() -> elm` | Return a random element from the collection.       |
