Welcome! We will start with an overview of Big O notation, building from CSCI 2720: Data Structures, and discuss how it may be requested or leveraged during a technical interview.

We'll then move into two challenge problems, one easier and one harder. 

When you have a solution, create a pull request! You can also post in our #csip Discord channel by using backticks (```) to start a multi-line code block. If you include your language of choice, you'll also get syntax highlighting!

Ex:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
````

Feel free to hand a copy of your resume or LinkedIn url to any current officer, and we'll have it back to you with critique by the next meeting!
