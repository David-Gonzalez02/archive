Welcome! We will start with an overview of Big O notation, building from CSCI 2720: Data Structures, and discuss how it may be requested or leveraged during a technical interview.

We'll then move into two challenge problems, one easier and one harder. We may open up additional voice channels for you to pair program or practice speaking through your approach. Keep an eye on the Discord channel for instructions if this happens!

When you have a solution, create a pull request! You can also post in our #csip Discord channel by using backticks (```) to start a multi-line code block. If you include your language of choice, you'll also get syntax highlighting! For full documentation, see [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-).

Ex:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
````

Feel free to hand a copy of your resume or LinkedIn url to any current officer, and we'll get it back to you with critique!
