'''A program for checking charges against a ruleset.

See the CSIP website for details of the problem:
http://csip.uga.edu/problems/2019-04-08/README

There are two parsing problems in this program: parsing the charge and parsing
the ruleset. Below, we describe the two languages in `Augmented Backusâ€“Naur
form (ABNF) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Backus-Naur_form>`_ .

The charge language is simple::

    charge     =  "CHARGE:" key-value "&" key-value "&" key-value "&" key-value
    key-value  =  key "=" value
    key        =  "amount" / "card_country" / "currency" / "ip_country"
    value      =  1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_")

Essentially, the charge starts with the prefix "CHARGE:" followed by four
key-value pairs separated by ampersands. Each key-value pair is written with an
equals sign as the separator. There are four possible keys, and every charge
will contain each key exactly once. The values are strings of alphanumeric
characters or the underscore. The amount value is interpreted as an integer and
the rest are interpreted as strings.

The charges are simple enough to parse. We can strip off the prefix, split on
the ampersand to get key-value strings, then split each key-value string on the
equals to get key-value pairs. The key-value pairs can then be passed to the
dictionary constructor. This logic is implemented on the `Charge` class.

The rule language is more complicated. The instructions provide a few
limitations that we could rely on, like there only being one "AND" or "OR", but
it's actually easier to write out a grammar for the language that is general
enough to handle more complex compounds. The grammar looks like this::

    rule          =  ("ALLOW:" / "BLOCK:") or-expr
    or-expr       =  and-expr *("OR" and-expr)
    and-expr      =  compare-expr *("AND" compare-expr)
    compare-expr  =  key ("==" / "!=" / "<" / "<=" / ">" / ">=") value
    key           =  "amount" / "card_country" / "currency" / "ip_country"
    value         =  1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_")

Essentially, a rule starts with a prefix of either "ALLOW:" or "BLOCK:" followed
by an OR-expression. An OR-expression is one or more AND-expressions separated
by "OR". An AND-expression is one or more comparison-expressions separated by
"AND". And a comparison-expression is a key-value pair separated by a comparison
operator. The keys and values are defined just as they are in the charge
language.

We implement this language with a simple recursive-descent parser. We have
classes for rules, OR-expressions, AND-expressions, and comparison-expressions.
Each of these has a ``parse`` method to construct an instance of the class from
a string. The parse method for rules calls the parse method for OR-expressions,
which in turn calls the parse method for AND-expressions, and finally that calls
the parse method for comparison-expressions. This recursive-ish nature is where
we get the term recursive-descent parser. Instances of these classes form a tree
that mirrors the structure of the grammar. This is called an abstract syntax
tree.

Each of these classes also have a ``match`` method which checks if an
expression applies to a charge. Just like the ``parse`` methods, the ``match``
method at each layer of the tree calls into the ``match`` method of the lower
level of the tree. This technique is called an abstract syntax tree interpreter.

To combine multiple rules, we have a top-level class for rulesets. The ruleset
class also has a ``parse`` method, but it takes in a list of strings, one for
each rule. Instead of a ``match`` method, the rulset has a ``check_charge``
method which returns true if the charge should be allowed and false if it should
be blocked.
