This week, we will be reviewing the topic of arrays. The concept of arrays are usually one of the very first concepts taught in a Computer Science curriculum and with good reason! Arrays are really important to understand since they are the framework behind many of the data structures we use, along with the actual architecture of our memory systems in our computers.

An array is defined as a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations arranged as a numbered sequence, so that each individual item can be referred to by its position number or index. By storing multiple items together like this, we can easily calculate the position of an element by imply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array.
