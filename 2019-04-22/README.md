For today's session, we won't follow a problem type theme as we've done previously. Instead we'll cover some various problems that are known to be popular choices in technical interviews. Remember when you're studying for interviews that the subject matter can touch on just about anything you've learned in your Computer Science classes (and sometimes things you haven't!). While this might make you feel like preparation isn't useful - the opposite is true! The better you understand the fundamentals - the easier it is to break down and solve problems you haven't seen before.

## P1: Card Shuffle
You have a deck of standard playing cards which contains:
- 4 suits: clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥) and spades (♠)
- 13 cards per suit: Ace(1) through 10
- 3 face cards per suit: King(K), Queen(Q), and Jack(J)
- 52 cards total

We will assume that the deck is represented with an array but the rest of the implementation is up to you. 

Given this array of cards, can you write an algorithm to shuffle the deck both effectively and efficiently?

## P2: Validate a BST
