## P1: Square Root

Today's first problem is easy to describe and lends itself to a variety of solutions: given an integer, `n`, compute its square root.

For simplicity's sake, we'll say that `n` is a non-negative integer less than `2^24`. It can be losslessly cast to a single precision float. Your output should be a single precision float that is accurate to three decimal places.

You may use a calculator to compute a few square-roots offline, but computing a table of all possible square roots doesn't count as a solution.

### Examples

For reference, `2^24 = 16,777,216`.

| Input      | Output   |
|------------|----------|
|          2 |    1.414 |
|      4,096 |   64.000 |
| 16,777,216 | 4096.000 |
