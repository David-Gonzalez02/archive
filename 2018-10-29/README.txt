Imagine that you are given an image that is represented by an N x N matrix, where each pixel in the image represented by a unique number.

Write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

{:style="line-height:1"}
```

╔═══╤═══╤═══╗
║ 1 │ 2 │ 3 ║
╟───┼───┼───║
║ 4 │ 5 │ 6 ║
╟───┼───┼───║
║ 7 │ 8 │ 9 ║
╚═══╧═══╧═══╝

90 degree clockwise rotation of the input matrix
╔═══╤═══╤═══╗
║ 1 │ 2 │ 3 ║
╟───┼───┼───║
║ 4 │ 5 │ 6 ║
╟───┼───┼───║
║ 7 │ 8 │ 9 ║
╚═══╧═══╧═══╝
```
